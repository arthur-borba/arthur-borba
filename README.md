**`digital craftsman / distro hopper`**

  Hi! I'm a beginner programmer currently teaching myself web development and ethical hacking (Wanting to start college asap, cybersecurity or computer science!), building my version of the digital world one step at a time. My biggest joy in the world is creating things, from plannning to designing, and building from the ground up things that i'm interested in!
  Being a guitar player and artist myself, i discovered the programming world and felt in love with it, because it opened so many doors for me to explore and express my deepest creative thoughts.
  
  Programming is art :floppy_disk:
